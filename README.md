# NGM-Sentiment-Analysis
Implementation of Neural Graph Machine inspired by the paper [2017 - Bui, Ravi Ramavajjala - Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04818) for binary Sentiment Analysis using the Large Movie Review Dataset. This is an optional project for a class in Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming
